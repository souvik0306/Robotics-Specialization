# Robotics-Specialization

This repo is a part of Coursera's Computational Motion Planning: Robotics Specialization by University of Pennsylvania 

Resources: 
1. Dijkstra's Algorithm - [[YouTube Tutorial]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB4MIexjvY0&ab_channel=AbdulBari)
2. Triangle Intersection - [[shubham3121's Code]](https://github.com/shubham3121/Computational-Motion-Planning/blob/master/Assignment2_CSpace/triangle_intersection.m)
3. Probablistic Road Map - [[souvik0306 Path Navigator Robot]](https://github.com/souvik0306/Path-Navigator-Robot)

Quiz - 1:

1. Same Length - Yes
2. Same except Opposite - No
3. Dimensions Increases - Exponentially
4. Fastest Algorithm - A*

Quiz - 2:
1. Both the geometry of the robot and the shapes of the obstacles in the environment  
2. The number of joints or degrees of freedom that the robot mechanism has. For example a robots that can translate and rotate in the plan will have a 3 dimensional configuration space reflecting 2 degrees of translational freedom and 1 rotational. A robot with 5 revolute joints will have a 5 dimensional configuration space.  
3. True
4. True
